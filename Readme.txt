🎊 RULES 🎊:
The game has 2 players, each taking their turn
Each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result is added to his ROUND score.
BUT, if the player rolls the dice and rolls a 1, his ROUND score is lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
The player can choose 'Hold', which means that his ROUND is added to the GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL wins the game.
